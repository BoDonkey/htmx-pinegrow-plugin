# HTMX plugin for Pinegrow
This plugin simplifies using the [HTMX library](https://htmx.org/) in the [Pinegrow Web Editor](https://pinegrow.com/) by adding all of the attributes as clickable actions. From the HTMX.org docs - "HTMX is a library that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML, rather than using javascript."

## Installation & Usage
To use this plugin, open a project and page in the Pinegrow Web Editor. Navigate to File -> Manage libraries & plugins and scroll to the bottom of the modal. Click on "Load plugin", select the 'pg-htmx.js' file, and click "add".

After selecting an element on the page you can open the Actions panel for a list of HTMX attributes to be added. That is it!

## Feedback
I would love to get any and all feedback on ways this could be improved. Thanks! :wave:
